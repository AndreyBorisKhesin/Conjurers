# Rural Network

Created by The Conjurers

Rural Network is a shopping app that utilizes the power of machine learning to streamline the 
shopping experience for consumers, while reducing costs for businesses.

First of all, imagine if you are running low on a daily necessity, you can simply snap a picture
of the product that you need and order delivery from the store or add it to your shopping list.
Also, this app reduces the need for consumers to stand in line to checkout and makes payment more convenient.
Furthermore, this app makes self-checkout more affordable for small businesses as eliminates the need for self-checkout machines and the extra space for putting them in stores. 

We trained our convolutional network to recognize various grocery items.
